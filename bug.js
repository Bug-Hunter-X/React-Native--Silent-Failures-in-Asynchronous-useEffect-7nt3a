In React Native, a seemingly innocuous error can stem from improperly handling asynchronous operations within the `useEffect` hook, especially when dealing with data fetching or complex state updates.  For example, consider this scenario where data is fetched and used to update the UI:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const jsonData = await response.json();
      setData(jsonData);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  if (data === null) {
    return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
  }

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

The issue lies in how `setData` is used. If `fetchData` throws an error (network failure, incorrect API endpoint), the `setData` call is never made, resulting in `data` remaining `null` indefinitely, leading to a non-updating UI and potentially a silent failure. This is because the `useEffect` hook won't know of the error and won't retry the fetch.

Another subtle error may happen when you have multiple `useEffect` hooks, and one is dependent on the other. A common mistake is forgetting that hooks execute asynchronously. So, when one hook is updating a state that another hook relies on, there is no guarantee that second hook will see the updated value in the same render.
